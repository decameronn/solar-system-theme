# Solar System Theme
ðŸ“Œ This is Work In Progress! ðŸ“Œ

## About
The marvelous Solar System imagined for VS Code - Choose your planet! âœ¨  
  
The aim of this theme collection is to bring you all the planets of the Solar System right into your favourite editor. We will be releasing one planet at a time.  
We hope you'll enjoy it (as much as we do!). 
### Release schedule
The initial schedule is to release additional "planets" once every two-weeks.  
The theme collection will be updated and you will have to reload VS Code before chosing the newest theme.

## Planets being born
The first planet to be released is Jupiter.  
While you get acquainted with it, more planets are in the process of being born.  
  
## While you wait for new planets to populate the Solar System
